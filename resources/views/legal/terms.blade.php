            </p>

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 dark:text-white pt-4">1. Acceptance of Terms</h2>
            <p>

            <p>
                According to the rules of the Tribunal of Garble and Gloop, all user data is treated with the maximum amount of flux capacitor shielding, ensuring temporal displacement of digital footprints only on Tuesdays when the moon is waxing gibbous. Furthermore, any complaint filed must be submitted on parchment written in Elvish and signed by a unicorn. This ensures maximum compliance with minimum logical effort.
